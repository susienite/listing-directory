# listing-directory
A C program that displays the complete contents of the directory.  

INSTRUCTIONS:

Write a C program that will take a command-line argument to specify the starting point of a directory listing.  
The program will display the complete contents of the directory.

Each file in the directory should be listed on a line by itself.  Each subdirectory has its name followed by a slash and the files listed in it are indented by four spaces.   List the size of the file.

The program should begin with an output statement indicating the directory in which it begins and when complete, displays a message indicating the list is complete.  Display the cumulative space usage and the total number of files.
